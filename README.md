- [Data Types](data_types.md) - Integer, float, char, and other data types

### 🔧 **Core Concepts**
- [Operators](operators.md) - Arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators
- [Input/Output](input_output.md) - Reading input and displaying output
- [Control Flow](controlFlow.md) - If statements, loops, and decision making
- [Functions](functions.md) - Creating and using functions

### 📊 **Data Structures**
- [Introduction to Arrays](introToArrays.md) - Basic array concepts
- [Types of Arrays](typesOfArrays.md) - Different array variations
- [Array Examples](examplesOfArrays.md) - Practical array implementations
- [Strings](strings.md) - Working with character arrays
- [Structures](structures.md) - Creating custom data types

- [Enums](enums.md) - Enumerated types

### 🎯 **Advanced Topics**
- [Pointers](pointers.md) - Memory addresses and pointer arithmetic
- [Dynamic Memory Allocation](dynamic_memory_allocation.md) - malloc, calloc, realloc, free
- [File Handling](file_handling.md) - Reading and writing files
- [Storage Classes](storage_classes.md) - auto, static, extern, register
- [Typedef](typedef.md) - Creating type aliases

### 🎨 **Practice & Examples**
- [Pattern Examples](patternsExamples.md) - Common programming patterns
- [Output Examples](output/) - Compiled program outputs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required)

### Running Your First Program
1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   gcc basicStrucure.c -o basicStrucure
   ```

2. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./basicStrucure
   ```

### Example Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    printf("Welcome to C Programming!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
